It was not that much difficult.
The needs were like that.

## Choose a proper environment setup repository from [here.](https://github.com/hivehelsinki/norminette-client)

```
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-bundler ruby-dev build-essential
git clone https://github.com/hivehelsinki/norminette-client.git ~/.norminette/
cd ~/.norminette/
bundle

echo 'alias norminette="~/.norminette/norminette.rb"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

that's it!
